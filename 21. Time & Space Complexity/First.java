/* 
Order and Space complexity:- Amount of space or time taken up by an algorith/code as function of input size.
It's not the actual time taken.

// Big O notation(O)-- It is used to visualize that in worst case, how can a program run in which time complexity. It tell the upper bound that what can be maximum time complexity.

//Big Omega Notation(Ω)-- It represents lower bond, which means it tells the time complexity in best case.

//Big Theeta Notation(Θ)-- It represents average bond


Now there is small o,omega and theeta too.

How tightly we can analyse time is big O and low lightly or loosely we can analyse is small o. And the same goes for theeta and omega.

# SPACE COMPLEXITY

Input space & Auxiliary space consists of space complexity.

Most of the time,our time is our priority.
